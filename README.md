# Godot Face Toon Shader
* This is an alternative to modifying face normals to achieve a similar look faster.
* Only one additional texture is necessary.
* You can create the texture from scratch or match your existing model's UVs to the default shadow map texture available inside the project.
* This project also includes a script where all the necessary shader parameters are passed to the shader from the scene.
* Also included inside the project is an outline shader, more info here [outline shader](https://godotshaders.com/shader/outline-shader-for-stylized-games/)
